I like to try new things out and see how I perform (and how I could do better).\\nThis is one of the reasons I decided to study Information Technology (IT) in the first place.\\n\\nIn this professional area, learning and sharing knowledge and experience is a must.\\nIT represents an entire world moving faster than any other I know of.\\nYesterday, you would hire someone to create your website from scratch.\\nToday, you can build it yourself with ChatGPT and other AIs which do most of the job for you.\\nThe fact that everything moves so fast and that you can\'t master every single tech that exists in this world makes it clear:\\n- Stop trying to know everything, rely on others and learn from them!\\n- Nobody knows everything, let people learn from you!\\n- Teamwork makes the difference, believe in others.\\n\\nAlthough I praise working in team, we are on the verge of a radical change in our society: there are currently a lot more people\\nwith 20-30 years of experience than younger people in the companies and they are not retiring yet.\\nThis has two downsides:\\n1. These experienced profiles are not always willingly updating their knowledge (and I can understand that they are tired and soon will stop working)\\nnor do they especially like to share with others.\\n2. The age difference makes it really hard to connect with newcomers.\\n\\n## Short career but lots of life experiences\\n\\nTo be honest, I have been in several companies in my career. I wanted to see how green the grass is here and there.\\nAnd I have always seen the same thing: unique profiles either trying to pull up teams and projects\\nor dooming everyone and everything, slowing down progress and burning money uselessly. Unfortunately for me, it is more like the second scenario.\\nDon\'t get me wrong though! I love creating. I love teamworking to bring people\'s solutions to life. And I especially love learning.\\nBut after around 3 years of professional work in various organizations, I grew tired of _those who do not aim for excellence as I do_.\\nI mean, why would you develop a digital solution if it is to do it like crap? All you do is shoot either your future self\\nor one of your fellows who will have to maintain it later on. Which is exactly why I decided to turn tables.\\n\\nI decided to work on that problem to prevent others from feeling like they try hard for nothing.\\nI wanted to avoid needless burnouts like many before me who grew tired of efforts thrown in waste.\\n\\n## Everything comes to those who wait\\n\\nFor the past two years, I was looking for a way to increase the value that us developers give to our businesses. But I mainly looked\\nfor ways to avoid weariness, exhaustion and overstrain.\\nIndeed, I felt my stress and tiredness levels raising way above average. I could not stand it, but had no idea how to solve the problems\\nI was facing...\\n\\nSurprisingly to me, in 2021, I got a message from a former teacher.\\nShe asked me if I was okay to take some hours at university to sub for a sick colleague.\\nThis was the trigger. Coming back to where everything started, where I got taught how to do my job, it made me realize a lot of things!\ud83e\udd29\\n\\nI had evolved. My experiences in the professional world connected me to knowledge and people. I discovered new ways of working, new ways of\\nthinking and I met my ideal. **I understood that I wanted to learn but above all, teach others.**\\n\\nSince then, I have been sharing my knowledge, mindset and how technical excellence can bring happiness in the proper environment.\\nWhether I am doing it for students at the Henallux, or at my clients\' in front of colleagues.\\n\\nThat made me realize where I wanted to go... \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n## Back to the basics\\n\\nHave you ever had this feeling that you did not understand the whole concept explained to you during class, training or whatever?\\nRest assured then, you\'re not alone! I graduated in 2019. Reading now the same lessons I had back then, what a difference!\\nI now can really see that I improved and learnt a bunch of stuff in a short time.\\nThis is really thrilling for the future! \ud83d\ude03\\n\\nHowever, it feels quite strange for the 24-year-old me to teach people of my age or sometimes older than I am.\\nAnd I have to admit that forcing myself to _go back to the basics_, to understand what I have to teach in order to vulgarize it\\nand **share my passion**, it genuinely is a growing experience.\\n\\nWhen I first took the teacher job, I was not sure about it. I mean, everyone has its share of impostor syndrome to deal with, right?\\nBut then, each time I took a new role there, I proved myself wrong. I get into the classroom, do my stuff and everyone goes home happy (except when I give homework\ud83d\ude01).\\n\\nThen you know, I kept thinking... Why is it so difficult to work if there are all that knowledge available and people don\'t know about it (or don\'t use it)?\\nI feel like the current professionals, often way older than me, lack of a fundamental element: the mindset.\\nAt the Henallux, we don\'t teach a language or a specific design pattern. We try to teach the students how to continuously improve. It does not\\nmatter that you don\'t know how to do C++, Cobol, NodeJS or Python. It does not matter that you don\'t know all the details about networking\\nor that you haven\'t experienced all the operation systems. _You can teach yourself!_\\n\\n## Teaching professionals?\\n\\nWhen I was working in Luxembourg, I met amazing people I immediatly considered as my mentors (\ud83d\udc4b [Guillaume Faas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaumefaas/) & [Yoan Thirion](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoanthirion/)).\\nI mean, they had the mindset! 3 days with them were more valuable than 5 weeks spent elsewere in terms of learning.\\nI brought that with me when I came back to Belgium (not them obviously..! the way they share what they know, and why they do it).\\n\\nThrough my current employer, I\'ve been sent to various clients who mainly considered me a developer.\\nBut my interest lies in the fact that I could help my clients improve.\\nI started looking for challenging missions where I could be more than a developer, where I could learn from them but teach them too!\\n\\nThen it happened. I had the incredible chance to bring my expertise in a wonderful walloon startup called [Pluriell](https://pluriell.app/).\\nThis new adventure \u2013 my first coaching(-only) mission ever \u2013 was extremely positive for this client! And me too!\\nThrough many discussions, presentations, custom accompaniements for specific problems, and code katas, I believe it gave them fresh insight,\\nnew methodologies, standards and objectives but mostly confidence and knowledge on what they (could) do right and what they (could) do wrong.\\nWhen it comes to what I learnt from them, apart from broadening my views on how you work in a Belgian startup, I can also say that it brought\\nme more experience and connections as a coach. It also definitely strengthened my will to interact with others, to teach and learn from them.\\nAnd honestly, backed by experienced professionals like Yoan and Guillaume who kept showing me the way, it felt like a wonderful trip.\\n\\nIn a more recent update of my life, I happened to become a co-organizer of the [Software Craftsmanship Luxembourg meetup](https://www.meetup.com/software-craft-luxembourg/)\\nwith Guillaume and [Arthur Grailet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-grailet-a647a1189/), for which we meet with other great individuals to share our understandings...\\nI am still learning the ropes, but being part of this community and forced to go out of my comfort zone is really something I missed from being a student.\\n\\n<a href=\'https://sathishkannan162.github.io/the-one-genius-lone-genius-myth/\'>\\n    <Figure\\n        data={{\\n            src: \'/img/no-genius-only-scenius.jpeg\',\\n            alt: \'No genius, only scenius\',\\n            type: \'image\'\\n        }}\\n    >\\n        There are no genius, only scenius!\\n    </Figure>\\n</a>\\n\\n## From dev to teacher & coach\\n\\nBeing a teacher is one thing. When you have to dive deep into JavaScript or explain how you can write efficient algorithms to people\\nwho just recently left their school\'s bench, it really forces you to reflect.\\nBut coaching people way older than you _in their own field_... this is new!\ud83d\ude06\\n\\nI think that both positions bring me the feeling to be _what I think is a real IT consultant_: to help people concretely.\\nThat obviously includes:\\n- to understand how they feel (often simply listen to them),\\n- to help them optimize the way they work by pointing out where they can improve,\\n- but also by showing them what they already do right!\\nAnd finally, the most important thing is... to discuss things, give pieces of advice based on the context and bring them new value.\\n\\nTeaching and coaching... these actions are actually quite close.\\nThe idea is to build a story, narrate it and believe that people grasp the morality out of it.\\nIf they don\'t, it is part of the job to attack from another angle in order to bring them what they require to go forward.\\n\\nI truly like the jobs. You need to understand how people think, and how you can convey the right information (and emotion) to them.\\nYou have to master your subject, and if not: be transparent and admit you don\'t know everything.\\nThey don\'t know either anyway, so you can (and should) just look it up with them so that everyone levels up!\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nSometimes you have to go back to your roots to grow bigger \ud83c\udf33\\n\\nI look forward to the surprises life will put next on my way, and I am sure everybody (and especially I)\\nwill learn more throughout the journey!\\n\\nBy the way, if you are looking for an Agile Technical Coach, hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tinael-devresse).\\n\\n<Newsletter url={websiteConfig.MAILCHIMP_URL} />"},{"id":"why-did-i-switch-to-clean-architecture","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/why-did-i-switch-to-clean-architecture","editUrl":"https://github.com/hunteroi/tinaeldevresse.eu/tree/master/blog/2022-06-01-why-did-i-switch-to-clean-architecture.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-01-why-did-i-switch-to-clean-architecture.mdx","title":"What architecture do I use for my projects?","description":"I decided to talk about the architecture choice I take when developing my app!","date":"2022-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"development","permalink":"/blog/tags/development"},{"inline":true,"label":"structure","permalink":"/blog/tags/structure"},{"inline":true,"label":"architecture","permalink":"/blog/tags/architecture"}],"readingTime":8.43,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"why-did-i-switch-to-clean-architecture","title":"What architecture do I use for my projects?","tags":["development","structure","architecture"],"description":"I decided to talk about the architecture choice I take when developing my app!","image":"/img/why-did-i-switch-to-clean-architecture.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Sharing is caring","permalink":"/blog/sharing-is-caring"},"nextItem":{"title":"Unit Testing","permalink":"/blog/unit-testing"}},"content":"import Figure from \'../src/components/Figure\';\\nimport SEO from \'../src/components/SEO\';\\nimport Reminder from \'../src/components/Reminder\';\\nimport Newsletter from \'../src/components/Newsletter\';\\nimport * as websiteConfig from \'../website_config.json\';\\n\\n<a href=\'/blog/why-did-i-switch-to-clean-architecture\'>\\n    <Figure\\n        data={{\\n            src: \'/img/why-did-i-switch-to-clean-architecture.png\',\\n            alt: \'My Love for Clean Architecture\',\\n            type: \'image\'\\n        }}\\n    />\\n</a>\\n\\nI decided to talk about the architecture choice I take when developing my apps!\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n<SEO\\n    uri=\'blog/why-did-i-switch-to-clean-architecture\'\\n    image=\'img/why-did-i-switch-to-clean-architecture.png\'\\n    type=\'article\'\\n/>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Reminder />\\n\\n---\\n\\nNot long ago, I have been asked the following by fellow developers:\\n\\n> How do you structure your projects because when they evolve, the basic n-tier architecture becomes more complex and they tend to create messy solutions.\\n\\nI don\'t have all the answers but what I actually said is that when it comes to my own projects, I make a simple choice:\\n\\n-   If I am working on a basic CRUD app, I will definitely go for a 3-Tier architecture.\\n-   But if I need to build a more complex app requiring a strong business logic and which must scream its goal,\\n    I will definitely use what Robert C. Martin called [the Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) in 2012.\\n    Of course, my version is not strictly following what Uncle Bob describes in his blog as I have tailored it to my needs but let\'s talk about it.\\n\\nNowadays though, I tend to be more inclined to use the latter. But **what does the Clean Architecture bring me that I love and that n-tier does not?**\\n\\n## The N-Tier architecture\\n\\n### What is it?\\n\\nFirst of all, it would be a shame to talk about the Clean Architecture and not talk about what I have learnt during my years at school: the n-tier architecture.\\nThis type of architecture is usually presented as and mixed up with one of its specific version: the 3-tier architecture.\\n\\nThis architecture places the data as the core of the application. The 3 layers are:\\n\\n1. the presentation layer, responsible of presenting the information to the outside ;\\n2. the logic layer, responsible of the business logic that should be applied on the data ;\\n3. the data layer, responsible of the data access.\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/3-tier-architecture.jpg\',\\n        alt: \'3-tier schema\',\\n        type: \'image\'\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\nOf course, the \\"n\\" in the name means that you can actually have less or more than 3 tiers. The layers described above are just the common ground.\\nThere are other types of comparable structures like the 2-tier architecture, the single tier, the 4-tier ...\\nWhen developing a project, you usually tailor the architecture to your needs. You could even subdivide the 3 common layers into sub-layers depending on your requirements.\\n\\n### Pros & Cons\\n\\nFor the **advantages**, we can list the following:\\n\\n-   more secure \u2014 The presentation layer (usually the UI or such) is not \\"directly\\" wired to the database. All connections to it are shielded by the logic layer.\\n-   easily maintainable \u2014 at the time of its \\"creation\\", this archi allowed the developers to maintain it much more easily than the previous architectures did.\\n-   easy to reuse \u2014 it is easier to reuse the logic of each layer.\\n\\nFor the **disadvantages**, let\'s have a quick look too:\\n\\n-   increase in effort \u2014 implementing new features takes time as you have to go through all tiers.\\n    Changing a single thing in the database layer is reflected to the logic and presentation layers as they directly rely on it.\\n-   increase in complexity \u2014 when it grows, it becomes more difficult to keep it clean, understandable and predict the impact of a change.\\n-   harder to test \u2014 implementing tests is quite difficult as everything is highly coupled to the layer it points toward.\\n\\n### When to use it?\\n\\nIn my humble opinion, using the n-tier architecture is a good start when you need to develop the prototype of an idea because you need to showcase something quickly.\\nThis will unfortunately tend to make things less great for the future though.\\n\\nYou could also use this archi when you need to build an easy CRUD app.\\nSpeaking of such, it is often used when you simply want to query a database. I once did that for one of my employers.\\n\\n## The Clean Architecture\\n\\n### What is it?\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/clean-architecture.jpg\',\\n        alt: \'Onion schema of CA\',\\n        type: \'image\'\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\nThis architecture puts the Domain at the center, and in charge of everything. It also requires more intentional designs as you do not rely on your database directly.\\nBuilt with the [CQRS pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html), I consider it the best way to write a software with maintainability and simplicity in mind.\\n\\nHistorical fact: the 3-Tiered architecture came in 1992 thanks to John J. Donovan and was followed by others afterwards:\\n\\n-   Hexagonal Architecture / Ports & Adapters (2005, Alistair Cockburn),\\n-   Onion Architecture (2008, Jeffrey Palermo),\\n-   Clean Architecture (2012, Robert C. Martin).\\n\\n### Pros & Cons\\n\\nFor the **advantages**, we can list the following:\\n\\n-   less coupled code, better testability \u2014 as the code is less coupled due to using abstractions everywhere you can, you can easily mock dependencies and unit test your components.\\n    It also facilitates the development in each layer as they are not highly coupled together, allowing teams to work in parallel on each layer.\\n-   separation of concerns \u2014 the architecture kind of forces you to think about your use cases and dependencies.\\n    The UI also does not care about how your database looks, nor does it care about the packages you use to generate a PDF for example...\\n-   better features exposition\\n-   better application of SOLID principles\\n-   better evolutivity\\n\\nFor the **disadvantages**, we can list the following:\\n\\n-   increase in time to build from scratch \u2014 you need to setup more things before starting to develop a valuable feature for the client.\\n-   increase in code \u2014 you need more files (classes and interfaces) than in an n-tier architecture.\\n-   possible loss of optimization \u2014 being closer to implementations might grant you better performances. You would lose this in profit of looser coupling which IMHO is a good trade-off.\\n\\nEditor\'s Note: Honnestly, reading this again... I don\'t feel like these are real disadvantages.\\nThey can be easily overcome with experience, and will make you gain time on the long run, especially if you decide to work with tests (which you should if you want to produce good code!).\\n\\n### When to use it?\\n\\nWhen you need to develop a complex software, that you want to test your features and want to deliver something valuable that will not increase the buglog once in production.\\nIt can also be mixed with methodologies that make it a strong reliability like [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) and [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\\n\\n## So why do I prefer CA over N-Tier?\\n\\nYou might know now but I am tired of developing crappy things, I\'m tired of working in a company where you get told to \\"develop fast and we will improve it later\\".\\nLater never comes.\\n\\nI am so tired of such way of working that I fell in love with 3 things:\\n\\n1. Clean Architecture, and\\n2. Test-Driven Development, and\\n3. [Software Craftsmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship).\\n\\nBut more seriously, I haven\'t explained _why_ I like it... In a few words, let me tell you.\\nYou need to know that developing an application without tests, it\'s like developing with your eyes closed: you do mistakes.\\nI then started digging this part of my job I was neglecting at the time: testing. Thanks to my professional experience at Pwc Luxembourg, I met wonderful people who taught me a lot of new things.\\n\\nThat was when I\'ve been asked to write an application following a particular architecture... And everything got solved once I practiced.\\n\\nDeveloping with Clean Archi, for me, it is the real culmination of software development where the technical \\"parts\\" can finally be changed without having to rework something else.\\nThe truth is, I learnt so much with Clean Architecture:\\n\\n-   I understood the real deal that Dependency Injection represents ;\\n-   I succeeded in applying SOLID principles better than all the other times I tried, in vain ;\\n-   I understod that I had to name my interfaces independantly of the implementation that could ensue from it since I could potentially have 3 different implementations of `IPdfGenerator` ;\\n-   I understood that testing _is_ fun ;\\n-   I understood that writing apps without bugs is possible and should be common.\\n\\nAnd I went to IT school! They explained what dependency injection, SOLID principles, clean code... are, they taught me how to prepare for a development and avoid the majority of bugs...\\nBut that doesn\'t mean I haven\'t written horrible code or buggy apps or patched a feature and broken something else in the process.\\n\\nSo, I highly encourage you to learn more about these 3 topics I listed above. The rest should come...\\nThey represent what I would love to call _the best mindset_ for the next generation of developers.\\n\\nI would also recommend to learn more by looking at the following resources:\\n\\n-   The presentation of Guillherme Ferreira on [The Grand Unified Theory of Clean Architecture and Test Pyramid](https://ndcporto.com/agenda/the-grand-unified-theory-of-clean-architecture-and-test-pyramid-0b9p/6537f85dc598) at NDC Porto ;\\n-   [Valentina Cupa\u0107\'s slides](https://www.jug.ch/events/slides/220201_Optivem_TDD_and_Clean_Architecture_Driven_by_Behaviour.pdf) about TDD and Clean Architecture driven by behaviour ;\\n-   A blog post relating an [introduction to CA](https://medium.com/codex/introduction-to-clean-architecture-2437c6987ec) ;\\n-   The example of such structure that is [Jason Taylor\'s Clean Architecture Template](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture)!\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhat finally makes the n-tier architecture obsolete is that it is actually _data-centric_ unlike the clean archi that is _domain-centric_ (logic).\\nIt took us time to understand that what gives value to our clients is not the data, but the business logic that allows to process that data!\\n\\nIf you are still interested in learning more on the topic, I also happened to stumble upon these online resources:\\n\\n-   [Samuel Oloruntoba\'s explanations](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) of the SOLID principles ;\\n-   [Mark Seemann\'s article](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2013/12/03/layers-onions-ports-adapters-its-all-the-same/) on the topic of adapters ;\\n-   [Sean G.

Can you introduce yourself please?</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 Hello Tina\xebl! Thank you for inviting me to speak on your blog. My name is Guillaume Faas and I am a .NET expert / Software Craftsman, currently working at [Squaremiled S.A.](https://squaremiled.com/).\\nI\'ve been building softwares since 10 years or so, in various environments and business sectors.\\n\\n<AnchoredH2 id=\'topic\'>The topic!</AnchoredH2>\\n\\n<AnchoredP>\ud83d\udd38 What are we going to talk about today?</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 What do you think? It seems someone did not read the post\'s title. We are going to talk about **unit testing**!\\n\\n<AnchoredP id=\'first-encounter\'>\\n    \ud83d\udd38 When did you first encounter unit testing?\\n</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 It was a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... I barely had a few years of experience.\\nI\'ve been working in the same company for most of my career and, compared to my day-to-day, I thought I had seen it all.\\nI started looking online in guideliens, best practices, patterns and so on... I came across a lot of exciting and above all new topics.\\nI seemed like I stepped in a new world that had nothing to do with my daily life in which I was stuck. The _testing_ was obviously one of those topics.\\nHowever, I quickly realised that I had to progress in other subjets before I could introduce tests in my projects. It took me quite a long time before I was really fit to work in a test-driven approach.\\n\\n<AnchoredP id=\'what-is-it\'>\\n    \ud83d\udd38 Ok! However, just not to lose our readers... can you explain what a unit\\n    test is please?\\n</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 Yes, of course! A unit test is a test that verifies a _unit of code_. This concept of unit of code varies according to the testing schools.\\nThe London (or Mockist) School will see it as the smallest chunk of code so we are talking about a class or a method.\\nOn the other hand, the Detroit (or Classicist) School will see it as a behavior so a group of classes or methods.\\nFor the most curious of you, here\'s an [article](https://medium.com/@adrianbooth/test-driven-development-wars-detroit-vs-london-classicist-vs-mockist-9956c78ae95f) which gives details on the differences between both schools. I want to clarify that no school is better than the other, each one having its pros and cons.\\nIt\'s only a matter of preference and compromise.\\nThe main difference is mainly the size of your _System Under Test_ (SUT) and the relationship between the different collaborators.\\n\\nBut in the end, a unit test is simply **a piece of code validating that another piece of code has the expected result and/or side effect against a given scenario**.\\n\\n<AnchoredP id=\'hierarchy-position\'>\\n    \ud83d\udd38 Alright. Where is it in this \\"test hierarchy\\"?\\n</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 It looks like the Agile Testing Pyramid but from left to right instead of bottom to top.\\nThe more on the left, the smaller your scope is and the most numerous and faster your tests will be.\\nIf you read it the other way and apply a reverse logic, it works too.\\n\\nWe are on the \\"unit\\" part for this topic since there is technically nothing smaller than a unit. A unit test should be executed on a standalone basis in a sandboxed environment.\\nThat is, a unit test has no impact on the outside of its scope, and if you run several of them in parallel, they must not have any side effect between them.\\n\\nThis finally means that in a unit test: we avoid reaching a database, making HTTP requests, accessing file system, etc. In the same way, we are not going to contact other dependencies of the solution.\\nWe strictly stay \\"internal\\" to the unit.\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/software-testing-types.png\',\\n        alt: \'Types of Software Testing\',\\n        type: \'image\'\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\nHere are a few points on the _functional testing_ part:\\n\\n-   unit testing is to check that a component works well. It is the fastest, we will talk about \\"fast feedback loop\\" ;\\n-   integration testing is to check that several components work well together ;\\n-   user acceptance testing consists of verifying the whole application while avoiding contact with external dependencies (eg: requests to external providers).\\n    This is the most representative test, probably the one that has the most value on the product scale as it validates business requirements.\\n\\nNote that you don\'t have to implement them all. We could have a test suite only composed of tests from a single category.\\nBut it should be borne in mind that our test suite will not be the most effective.\\n\\n<AnchoredP>\\n    \ud83d\udd38 Nice! But why is testing not used everywhere in the profesionnal world?\\n</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 In reality, a large part of developers write little to no tests. In addition, integration tests are less common than unit tests because they are more complex to write.\\nIn the end, this task is often seen as a chore or an extra step that we will only do if we have time.\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n\\t\\tsrc: randomChoose(\\n\\t\\t\\t\'/img/integration-tests.gif\',\\n\\t\\t\\t\'/img/more-unit-tests-no-integration-tests.gif\',\\n\\t\\t\\t\'/img/unit_vs_integration_tests.gif\'\\n\\t\\t),\\n        alt: \'GIF on integration tests\',\\n        type: \'image\'\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\nUncle Bob also spoke about it at a conference in London in 2018:\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        type: \'html\',\\n        width: \'560\',\\n        height: \'315\',\\n        src: \'https://www.youtube.com/embed/17vTLSkXTOo?start=552&end=720\',\\n        title: \'YouTube video player of SC London Conference 2018\',\\n        allow: \'accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\',\\n        allowFullScreen: true\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\n<AnchoredP id=\'objective\'>\\n    \ud83d\udd38 What is the objective of unit testing and when should it be applied?\\n</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 The goal is quite simple: it\'s to show that a method works as expected. That is, you are going to have an expected behavior. For example, a method `getSomething` should return you something.\\nYou are thus going to test different scenarios and check that the method always behaves the right way.\\n\\nAs for the \\"when\\", it\'s even simpler: you need to apply unit testing whenever you have some logic somewhere.\\n\\n<AnchoredP id=\'pros-and-cons\'>\\n    \ud83d\udd38 Alrighty! What are the pros and cons of such thing?\\n</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 As previously said, you write code to test code. Seen like this, it surely looks like additional workload but there are realy interests behind!\\n\\n1. The unit test acts as a **safety net against regressions**.\\n\\nThe refactoring stage systematically occurs in a projet. The problem is, when you start changing something, there is always **a risk of regression**.\\nWe talk about regression when something that used to work does not anymore due to some changes.\\nIt\'s precisely here that a unit test intervene: it guarantees that your components always work as expected. If anything does not work anymore after a refactoring, the test suite is going to display erroneous code with a beautiful red dot.\\nAnd that, from the point of view of a developer, it\'s huge! It means you can be much more relaxed and spend less time checking that your changes did not have undesirable effect on the rest of the features.\\n\\n2. Writing tests improves the **code quality** of your app.\\n\\nIt is related to the above that we have just discussed. It is likely that the readers have already encountered a similar situation:\\nwhen talking about refactoring to a Product Owner or a Product Manager, the first fear is always that is not working anymore.\\nIf you are covered by a test suite, you are not afraid of refactoring. It\'s even the opposite, **you are encouraged to refactor regularly** while being protected.\\n\\n3. A test suite becomes what we call **a living documentation**.\\n\\nWhen we talk about documentation, we might all have commentaries in mind. The problem is that they are never up to date with the rest of the code. The code evolves, the documentation does not.\\nHowever, your unit test will always be up to date. If it wasn\'t, your test suite wouldn\'t give you the green light to go further.\\n\\nIt\'s even more interesting when^in the context of the arrival of a new developer on the project. Rather than reading all the code of a method to know what it does, they can just look at the different tests for that specific method.\\nEach behavior will be represented by a test with an explicit naming on the scenario and expected result (eg: `GetItem_ShouldReturnNotFoundResult_GivenItemIsMissing`). **It makes the onboarding process easier!**\\n\\n4. It **reduces the bug detection time**.\\n\\nWe mentioned the concept of \\"short feedback loop\\" earlier. Unit tests are really fast to execute, they give an almost instantaneous feedback on the health of the solution.\\nThis means that we need to regularly execute them. Let\'s say we have a button (or a shortcut) that gives us a Green/Red status in a few seconds. Activating this button must become systematic.\\n\\nIt already has an interest for us developers but that\'s not all. We\'ll talk about it later!\\n\\n5. It is not a direct advantage but more like a side effect: **testing makes you better**.\\n\\nTo ensure you write tests that provide real value, there are certain principles that you need to follow. You must always have a certain layer of abstraction to _mock_ your dependencies, you must be able to inject them, you must limit the responsibilities of your components, etc.\\nIn fact, you will force yourself to apply several principles regularly (eg: SOLID). Suddenly, it forces you to break your components, to decouple them, to think about their interactions and responsibilities. In short, to think and ask yourself a lot of questions.\\nCasually, we are talking about _code design_! And so, action-reaction: you get better over time. Sounds very \\"Happy End\\" but you know where I\'m going with this.\\n\\n\ud83d\udd38 And as it is not that much introduced in companies, it\'s kinda \\"new\\" and motivates to learn more!\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 I agree with you on the novelty aspect but it only remains present when the subject is discovered. And there\'s an interpretive part to it all: some (like you) see it as something interesting. Others see it as a chore or extra pressure.\\nYou will always find people resistant to testing for a variety of reasons. Perhaps we will have the opportunity to address the reasons that are generally mentioned...\\n\\nTo get back to the question, here are the cons that come to my mind:\\n\\n1. Already mentioned, but there are pre-requisites: you have to understand the foundation of the Object-Oriented, dependency injection, [SOLID](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) principles, etc.\\n2. The fact that there are few projects with real test suites makes learning less accessible. The same goes for a coach passionate about this subject.\\n3. There\'s a fairly steep learning/progression curve. Everyone goes through a phase of frustration at the beginning because we are not comfortable and we have the impression of being slower.\\n   We must resist and persevere because the tests will actually make us go faster in the long go. We will talk about it with the TDD approach.\\n4. It requires preparation: you have to think about the project\'s architecture, the relationships between the different components, etc. Seen like this, it isn\'t really a disadvantage but we can\'t (won\'t anymore?) go headlong in a development without a minimum of thought.\\n5. There is a lack of comprehension on the side of other teams involved in the proect development, especially non-IT\'s. We always fall back on discussions about the \\"Return On Investment\\" (ROI) or the impact on velocity.\\n\\nWe often hear that \\"it takes time\\" or \\"it will be planned later\\" or \\"developers don\'t have time\\" but those arguments are not really valid.\\nIndeed, the first one clearly indicates a lack of long term vision and understanding of testing. Because \\"later\\" never happens but above all, writing the tests at the end of a product\'s development doesn\'t make any sense. We lose all benefits of testing. I already said it but we will talk about it with the TDD approach.\\nThen, the second indicates an organizational problem. The tests should be included in the time estimates of developping a feature and not as additional work to be done.\\n\\n<AnchoredP id=\'test-coverage\'>\ud83d\udd38 What about the test coverage?</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 Testing is great, we feel the benefits. However, we is also necessary to make a status on the state of the test suite. This is when we start talking about \\"code coverage\\". It is an informative metric about your app\'s test coverage process.\\nI really insist on the \\"informative\\" side. It would be a mistake to measure the quality of the test suite based on its coverage. It is a metric of quantity, not quality.\\nI have already read articles about companies that have incorporated the value of code coverage into developer goals and this has prompted developers to use mock tests to boost the coverage.\\n\\nThe only way to check the quality of a test suite of a project is to ask yourself a few questions:\\n\\n-   Does the general feature development time stay approximately the same over time?\\n-   Does the quantity of bugs found in production decrease over time?\\n-   Do you easily manage to welcome new resource within the development team?\\n-   Do the developers trust their test suite? Is it representative of the state of health of the solution? Does a green circle really guarantee that a component is working?\\n\\nIf you are able to answer \\"yes\\" to all these questions, congrats! You can be proud of the test suite that you have put in place.\\nThe problem? It is really difficult to have an answer to all these questions when you have to report _day one_... You also notice that the first three refer to **time**.\\n\\n<AnchoredP id=\'cost\'>\\n    \ud83d\udd38 Well... Cost wise, where are we? Because ultimately, writing a test means\\n    writing code. It costs!\\n</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 I see where you are going with this. No, it does not cost more unless you charge to characters!\\nEven if you write more code, you really win and not only on the time aspect. Did I tell you we had to talk about the TDD approach? Because it even saves you time in short term. Anyway!\\n\\nDeveloping a feature may take you a little longer, knowing that it will mostly depend on your ease to write tests.\\nOn the other hand, it will especially \\"save your life\\" a lot of times because you will avoid a lot of bugs which, in normal times, would have arrived much later in your process, during user testing on a QA environment or in production.\\n\\nBut you wanted to talk about money! **The later a bug is discovered, the more it costs**:\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/relative-costs-bugs-fixing.png\',\\n        alt: \'Cost of bug fix\',\\n        type: \'image\',\\n        url: \'https://deepsource.io/blog/exponential-cost-of-fixing-bugs/\'\\n    }}\\n>\\n    Cost of bug fix based on the moment it was detected, sourced from <a href=\'https://deepsource.io/blog/exponential-cost-of-fixing-bugs/\'>DeepSource</a>!\\n</Figure>\\n\\nAnd is totally normal.\\n\\nWe can talk again about the \\"fast feedback loop\\": if a bug is found by a unit test, it\'s in local, on your machine, just after a change (don\'t forget to rebuild and rerun your test suite!). The bug is quickly identified and fixed.\\n\\nIn contrast, a bug that goes to production... is discovered by a user who must report the problem to your product team who must analyze the feedback and open a ticket in your backlog.\\nThis ticket will be prioritized by your Product Owner to be included in the next iteration and then it will be assigned to a developer. Assuming that it is not you, there will be an investigation phase (reproduction of the bug), a bug correction phase and after that it goes through all environments and be validated by Quality Assurance Users.\\n\\nI deliberately took an extreme case scenario to show the worst possible but it\'s also the best way to be explicit about the problem.\\nThe important thing to remember is that **a test can save a lot of people a lot of time, no matter how simple it is**.\\n\\n_Ed: to learn more about the reasons that softwares have bugs, do not hesitate to consult [this page](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/why-does-software-have-bugs) and [others on the web](https://www.google.com/search?q=why+do+softwares+have+bugs)!_\\n\\n<AnchoredH2 id=\'details\'>In depth</AnchoredH2>\\n\\n<AnchoredP id=\'black-and-white-boxes\'>\\n    \ud83d\udd38 Ok! What about we talk about black box and white box testing now?\\n</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 I like diagrams, do you like diagrams? Diagrams are great!\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/black-white-box-testing.png\',\\n        alt: \'Black and white box testing\',\\n        type: \'image\',\\n        style: { border: \'.5em solid black\' }\\n    }}\\n>\\n    The differences between black and white box testing\\n</Figure>\\n\\n**Black box testing** consists in giving an input to the SUT and check the output. It\'s that simple: we don\'t take into account things happening inside the method.\\nThere\'s an accurate case scenario where this type of testing is mandatory: pure methods. Those having no dependencies or shared variables have no side effect.\\nIt\'s therefore obvious to use black box testing. It makes the test extremely robust because nothing impacts its result.\\n\\nLet\'s take a `Sum` method from a `Calculator` class as an example. We are exactly on the scenario mentioned above:\\n\\n```csharp title=\'tests/CalculatorTests.cs\'\\n[TestClass]\\npublic class CalculatorTests\\n{\\n\\t[TestMethod]\\n\\tpublic int Sum_Should_ReturnTheSumOfTheTwoNumbers()\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tCalculator calculator = new();\\n\\n\\t\\tint result = calculator.Sum(2,3);\\n\\n\\t\\tAssert.AreEqual(expected: 5, actual: result);\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe don\'t know the method\'s implementation, but we wrote a test. We give it input data, and check the output.\\nFor the other scenarios we haven\'t talked about yet, I find it a shame to stop there.\\nIt\'s a personal feeling, but I find **white box testing** more relevant as a _mockist_.\\n\\nSo yeah, on the other hand, we thus have **white box testing**. At first sight, it is the same process: we give an input and check the output.\\nBut we are also going to check what\'s going on _inside_ the SUT: check that it called its dependencies correctly, that the value has been correctly cached or saved in a repository, that an event has been emitted, etc.\\n\\nThis allows us to check each **behavior** and their **side effects**.\\n\\n<AnchoredP id=\'how-to-write\'>\\n    \ud83d\udd38 The most awaited question ever... How do we write good unit tests?\\n</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 I don\'t think there are good or bad unit tests... No, just joking!\\nYou need to think on what to do before actually doing it. That can sound silly but just think before you do.\\nThat\'s what I was explaining when I was talking about the fact that testing makes you better.\\nIf you want to write efficient tests, you need to think on the way your components are going to communicate with each other.\\nActually, your tests will be efficient once they are easy to do. And if you realize they are not, there is something wrong with your code.\\n\\neg: I\'ve got a service that has to create a user. **Before writing my test**, I have to ask myself a few questions:\\nwhat is the responsability of my service? Is it responsible or sending an HTTP request to an external provider to get information?\\nIs it responsibile for database persistence? Is it responsible of the logging?\\n\\n**Divider and Conquer**: a dependency here, one there, another there... Finally, what\'s left in your service?\\nThe orchestration of a process delegated to different dependencies (eg: http client, repository, logger, etc.) and possibly a modification of the state of an entity. That\'s it.\\n\\nIn the end, a \\"good\\" test must:\\n\\n-   protect you against regressions ;\\n-   be resistant to refactoring ;\\n-   give you a quick feedback ;\\n-   be maintainable.\\n\\n<AnchoredP id=\'tips-to-start\'>\\n    \ud83d\udd38 What about you give us some tips to start our journey?\\n</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 I recommend people who want to start testing to start with the **Test Driven Development** approach.\\nWriting the test of a method after its implementation is not really the goal because you already know the implementation so your test will be highly coupled to your implementation.\\nIn addition, your code already works so the test would probably be seen as a time loss. But above all: we don\'t benefit of any advantage of testing during the implementation phase.\\n\\nYou are not alone. There are tons of resources available to help you out.\\nHere are some books that I wish I have read early in my career:\\n\\n-   \\"Test Driven Development - By Example\\" by Kent Beck ;\\n-   \\"Unit Testing - Principles, Practices and Patterns\\" by Vladimir Khorikov.\\n\\nAnd here\'s a website filled with tips and tricks on TDD with a large number of katas to progress: [TDD Buddy](http://www.tddbuddy.com/).\\n\\nSpeaking of katas, do katas. Do a lot of katas and do them with other (pair and/or mob programming) if you can.\\nIt is fun and very educational, especially when starting with simple exercises and gradually increasing the difficulty until you end up with situations similar to what you can find in real projects.\\nIn addition to TDD Buddy, I would also suggest people to check out [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) if you are hungry for inspiration.\\nAnd without necessarily doing self-promotion, you can also find some katas on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Tr00d/).\\n\\nLast but not least piece of advice to start testing: we can refer to what is called the triple A (AAA), which means \\"Arrange, Act, Assert\\", in order to make the tests more clear and organized.\\nThe goal is to divide a unit test in 3 distinct parts:\\n\\n1. **arrange**: this is the scenario, the part where you prepare the input data of your method ;\\n2. **act**: it is the action, the fact of carrying out the call to the method that you are going to test ;\\n3. **assert**: this is the behavior check, the part where you check the output or the side effects.\\n\\n<AnchoredP id=\'bad-smells\'>\\n    \ud83d\udd38 What are the \\"bad smells\\" in unit testing?\\n</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 I see a few of them...\\n\\n-   an \\"arrange\\" part that has like 15 lines... It is way too complicated. We clearly see that the tested method does too many things because the scenario is tough to prepare!\\n-   We say that **a test should have one and only one reason to fail**. A test should contain a single assertion.\\n-   The fact that you have trouble writing unit tests, not because you don\'t have the necessary knowledge but rather in relation to the code to be tested... this means there is a problem at the level of your component.\\n    So take a step back and think about the responsibilities.\\n\\n<AnchoredH2 id=\'to-go-further\'>To go further</AnchoredH2>\\n\\n<AnchoredP id=\'libraries\'>\\n    \ud83d\udd38 Do you have interesting libraries in mind to ease our work?\\n</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 Yes. We can consider 3 groups of libraries:\\n\\n1. testing ones which allow to generate tests ;\\n2. mocking ones which allow to overload the behavior of your dependencies and monitor them ;\\n3. data generation ones.\\n\\nFor me:\\n\\n|                      **Test Frameworks**                       |                  **Mocking Libraries**                   |               **Data Generation Libraries**                |\\n| :------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |\\n| [MSTest](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MSTest.TestFramework/) |        [Moq](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Moq/)        | [AutoFixture](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AutoFixture/) |\\n|         [NUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit/)         |    [NInject](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ninject/)    |\\n|         [XUnit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/xunit/)         | [WireMock](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WireMock.Net/) |\\n\\n\ud83d\udd38 I would like to retain the attention of the readers on this particular point... but there are librairies for the front-end too. In fact, unit testing is not reserved for back-end developers.\\nWe\'ll mention [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest), [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha), [Cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress) and [Jasmine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine) as wellknown librairies for JavaScrit applications.\\n\\n<AnchoredP id=\'what-is-tdd\'>\\n    Well anyways! You can\'t stop mentioning it so here it is: what is Test\\n    Driven Development (TDD)?\\n</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 Glad you finally asked! It\'s not like I gave you multiple openings... TDD is joy, happiness, the ultimate answer to the meaning of life, it\'s all of that!\\nNo, just kidding. In fact, it\'s more of a way of putting tests at the center of what you do. We talked about positive points of unit testing, and we also said that we would lose them by doing tests at the end, but we did not go into details.\\n\\nThe best way to benefit all the advantages of doing tests is to do them first but it is not just that. It doesn\'t mean first doing all the tests and then implementing all the methods.\\nNo, there\'s a kind of iterative aspect which we also find in Agility. You go _step by step_ (baby steps), you add new behaviors ensuring the previously added ones still work. The safety net grows little by little naturally.\\nWe can even present this differently: think about a ladder. It will always be easier to climb it step by step instead of three by three.\\n\\nI would add that contrary to popular belief, TDD does not make the development time longer.\\nFor example, it is not necessary to run the whole solution to know that the code is working because it has been developed entirely on a tests basis.\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/test-driven-development.png\',\\n        alt: \'Cycle du TDD\',\\n        type: \'image\',\\n        style: { border: \'.5em solid black\' }\\n    }}\\n>\\n    The TDD cycle\\n</Figure>\\n\\nFirst thing first, you need to write **one** unit test. This test should normally _have to_ fail since no implementation has been written for it to pass.\\nThe second step is to write the code which will make the test go green (pass). It is very important that this _passage_ from red to green must be **as short as possible**.\\nIt\'s the moment when we have the right to write \\"ugly\\" code (hardcoding a value, to duplicate code, to paste a response from StackOverflow, etc.). It may seem weird at first but there is a real benefit: checking that adding a new behavior is possible without breaking everything that has been done before.\\nThe next step is the refactoring phase. We did write some horrible code, so now we need to make it clean. I spoke about refactoring being easier and safer: here we are! We have our \\"green light\\" and the behavior is guaranteed as long as the light remains green. We have our fast feedback loop at hand (or click, or shortcut) to know if everything\'s OK. Got it?\\nAnd after that, we reach the end of the cycle. That means one thing: we start over again.\\n\\n\ud83d\udd38 I\'m gonna give a little example so that everyone fits! I am going to do it with a string length calculator because it\'s easy to do.\\nSo, we start by writing a unit test:\\n\\n```csharp title=\'tests/StringCalculatorTests.cs\'\\n[TestClass]\\npublic class StringCalculatorTests\\n{\\n\\t[TestMethod]\\n\\tpublic int Length_ShouldReturn_CorrectLength()\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tStringCalculator calculator = new();\\n\\n\\t\\tint result = calculator.Length(\\"string\\"); // \\"string\\" is 6 characters long, right?\\n\\n\\t\\tAssert.AreEqual(expected: 6, actual: result);\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe test fails because I haven\'t created the `StringCalculator` class yet. Next step!\\n\\n```csharp title=\'src/StringCalculator.cs\'\\npublic class StringCalculator\\n{\\n\\tpublic int Length (string str)\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\treturn 6; // hardcoding the value for the shortest test resolution possible\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nHere, I\'m passing at the green stage. So now, only the blue one remains.\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 I would like to say that this is a very ugly code because you hardcoded the value. And this is great! It\'s the goal!\\n\\n\ud83d\udd38 Now the longest: carry out a code refactinrg which allows us to meet the requested need (calculate the length of a string) without breaking the test:\\n\\n```csharp title=\'src/StringCalculator.cs\'\\npublic class StringCalculator\\n{\\n\\tpublic int Length (string str)\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\treturn str.Length; // cleanest way to return the length of a string in C#\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nVoil\xe0! We can now start the writing of another unit test.\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 It\'s a really simple example but you did it. It should be noted that there are some rules to respect with TDD but I could talk about it for hours so we will stop here!\\n\\n<AnchoredP id=\'what-is-tcr\'>\\n    \ud83d\udd38 Nice! By the way, I heard you recently learnt about \\"Test &amp;&amp;\\n    Commit || Revert\\" (TCR). What is it?\\n</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 Exact, I had the chance to get to know about this practice via a workshop. To schematize, let\'s say it is an extreme vision of TDD. The best way to apply it is with a separated script.\\nThis script will analyze your solution at each save and then execute your test suite. If all the tests pass, it creates a commit representing a stable state of your branch (Test &amp;&amp; Commit).\\nIf a single test does not pass anymore, it will roll back to the former commit (Revert), which is stable.\\nThis forces you to go in baby steps, and one thing is highlighted: it is your last change which broke something.\\n\\nAt the beginning, you go through a frustration phase because you lose some code but precisely this encourages you to go forward little step by step to limit your losses. The smaller your steps are, the less you risk to lose. It\'s a great teaching in addition to TDD.\\nWhen you become relatively comfortable with all of this, you notice that you go faster and faster and above all: you always have a working branch.\\n\\n<AnchoredH2 id=\'conclusion\'>Conclusion</AnchoredH2>\\n\\n<AnchoredP>\ud83d\udd38 Do you have a last word for this interview?</AnchoredP>\\n\\n\ud83d\udd39 \\"Victoriae mundis et mundis lacrima\\", which does not make any sense but I feel it\'s relatively cool.\\nMore seriously, we have been discussing for a while now but we\'ve only scratched the surface. There are still a lot of things to discuss about testing. I would urge your readers to be curious and the topic and to read **and** practice.\\nAnd do not hesitate to ask for help around you!\\n\\nAnd now, are you interested in testing?\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/developers-deliver-working-solutions.jpg\',\\n        alt: \'Developers deliver working solutions, not testable code\',\\n        type: \'image\',\\n        style: { width: \'50%\', border: \'.1em grey solid\' }\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\n<Newsletter url={websiteConfig.MAILCHIMP_URL} />\\n\\nexport const toc = [\\n    { value: \'Presentation\', id: \'presentation\', level: 2 },\\n    { value: \'The topic\', id: \'topic\', level: 2, },\\n        { value: \'First encounter\', id: \'first-encounter\', level: 3 },\\n        { value: \'What is it\', id: \'what-is-it\', level: 3 },\\n        { value: \'Where is it in the tests hierarchy\', id: \'hierarchy-position\', level: 3 },\\n        { value: \'Objective of unit testing\', id: \'objective\', level: 3 },\\n        { value: \'Pros and cons\', id: \'pros-and-cons\', level: 3 },\\n        { value: \'Test Coverage\', id: \'test-coverage\', level: 3 },\\n        { value: \'The cost\', id: \'cost\', level: 3 },\\n    { value: \'In depth\', id: \'details\', level: 2 },\\n        { value: \'Black box &amp; white box, what is that\', id: \'black-and-white-boxes\', level: 3 },\\n        { value: \'How to write them efficiently\', id: \'how-to-write\', level: 3 },\\n        { value: \'Tips to start\', id: \'tips-to-start\', level: 3 },\\n        { value: \'Bad Smells\', id: \'bad-smells\', level: 3 },\\n    { value: \'To go further\', id: \'to-go-further\', level: 2 },\\n        { value: \'Librairies to simplify the work\', id: \'libraries\', level: 3 },\\n        { value: \'Test Driven Development\', id: \'what-is-tdd\', level: 3 },\\n        { value: \'Test &amp;&amp; Commit || Revert \', id: \'what-is-tcr\', level: 3 },\\n    { value: \'Conclusion\', id: \'conclusion\', level: 2 }\\n];"},{"id":"what-is-a-container","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/what-is-a-container","editUrl":"https://github.com/hunteroi/tinaeldevresse.eu/tree/master/blog/2021-06-01-what-is-a-container.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2021-06-01-what-is-a-container.mdx","title":"What is a Container?","description":"Hello!

Why choosing Docusaurus when there are plenty of other site generators such as Wix, Shopify, Weebly, ... or more axed on a developer mindset such as Next.js, Hugo, Gatsby, and so on...\\n\\nWell, I kind of discovered it by pure chance when looking for a documentation generator for .NET (by the way, I found it: [Docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/)).\\nHowever, I personnaly chose Docusaurus for my personal projects for 3 reasons: it is...\\n\\n1. [open-source](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) (it means I can contribute, consult its source code, etc.),\\n2. developed in React (I love this library),\\n3. easy to use (in around 3 minutes, you can have a functional and customized website).\\n\\n### This website is generated with Docusaurus\\n\\nIf you haven\'t noticed it yet, this blog is generated with Docusaurus v2. You can even find the source code here on [Github](https://github.com/hunteroi/tinaeldevresse.eu).\\nIf you see any typo, please open an issue!\\n\\nOkay, let\'s move on to the next and main topic: our introduction to containers.\\n\\n## The containers\\n\\n### What are we talking about?\\n\\nOne of the many problems in software development is that we are highly coupled to the machine on which we write code.\\nWhether it is for development or when it comes to deploy a web service for clients, there is always a machine somewhere hosting the app.\\nAnd the issue is that the systems and configurations are different..!\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/it-works-on-my-machine.jpg\',\\n        alt: \'It Works On My Machine - meme\',\\n        type: \'image\'\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\nA container is a standard unit of software packaging code and its dependencies to quickly and reliably run an application from one isolated environnement to another.\\nIt\'s just like you let the client use your own computer.\\n\\n### What are the differences with a Virtual Machine?\\n\\nIt is true that containers are often compared to virtual machines (VM) in that they have the same goal: run an app in an embedded environment.\\nThe big difference between each is that a container makes use of the host machine operating system (OS) whereas a VM loads its own OS.\\n\\nIn fact, a machine with Docker installed brings the following advantages:\\n\\n-   lightweightness and speed,\\n-   portability and standardization, thus cross-platform (at some extent).\\n\\nIn reality, it is understandable. Let\'s take a look at this drawing:\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/container_against_VM.png\',\\n        alt: \'Container VS Virtual Machine\',\\n        type: \'image\'\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\nIt is a schema comparing a server with Docker installed to a server that handles VMs.\\nThanks to my excellent drawing skills, we can quickly understand why Docker offers lightweight and speed as assets: Docker is based on the host machine\'s installed OS and reuses its binaries.\\nThis means that the machine only has to load the containers packaging code, environment variables, etc. (so to speak, a few light things).\\n\\nOn the other hand, a system which uses VMs has a hypervisor which handles everything. This hypervisor indeed uses the host machine\'s installed OS.\\nHowever, each VM ships with its own OS and binaries.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we can have a machine easily running 500 containers with a single OS. But it\'s not the same story with 500 VMs...\\nEventhough it\'s actually more complex to efficiently manage several containers simultaneously.\\n\\nYet, the power of Docker can also reveal itself as a weakness: it is not possible to run a container which depends on Windows on a Linux machine (and vice versa).\\n\\nAnother important problem that arises when using Docker is obviously the security!\\nThe containers may be isolated... but if even one of them is compromised, it is likely that the whole machine (and thus the entire set of containers) represents a threat.\\n\\n### How does it work?\\n\\nI\'m gonna lay the foundations, so that we speak with the same language. By the way, I am referencing Docker specically.\\nIt is made up of 3 components:\\n\\n1. the software, called Docker daemon, is a process managing Docker containers and resulting objects (eg: Docker Engine, ...)\\n2. the objects, themselves seperated in 3 categories, are entities which allow to build an application with Docker:\\n    - a **container** is a standard environment running an application.\\n    - an **image** is a read-only template used to build a container. We can then say that an instance of an image is a container.\\n    - a **service** is a system which orchestrates the operations of several containers managed by multiple daemons. It is also called a _swarm_ (a set of Docker daemons which communicate via Docker - eg: Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, ...).\\n3. the registries are repositories for Docker images (eg: Docker Hub, Google Cloud Platform, ...)\\n\\nTo create a container, you must follow some principles:\\n\\n-   a container only runs one process ;\\n-   a container is immutable (it means that with the same environment variables, the container will run the _same process_) ;\\n-   a container is disposable (it means that we can remove it, change it, ... as we like).\\n\\nThese 3 principles are just the most important in my humble opinion, but you may find the complete methodology on [\\"The Twelve Factors\\"](https://12factor.net/) website.\\n\\nOnce you have an image locally (whether you took it from a registry or built it locally), you can create a container. I could show it to you, but as I don\'t reinvent the wheel, you will find a small video which explains it very well!\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        align: \'center\',\\n        type: \'html\',\\n        width: \'560\',\\n        height: \'315\',\\n        src: \'https://www.youtube.com/embed/iqqDU2crIEQ\',\\n        title: \'YouTube video player of Docker tutorial\',\\n        allow: \'accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\',\\n        allowFullScreen: true\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\n### Why would you use Docker or any of its competitors?\\n\\nThe principle of containerisation brings significant benefits. Here\'s a non-exhaustive list:\\n\\n-   faster & easier onboarding of new human resources ;\\n-   certitude that you and your colleagues work on the same environment (including the same version of tools) ;\\n-   enforcement of the \\"Do Not Reinvent The Wheel\\" principle since an access to open-source images is possible ;\\n-   faster building and destroying compared to VM ;\\n-   consistency environmenet and isolation ;\\n-   broad compatibility (the development machine OS does not matter, so everyone can work on their favorite station).\\n\\nContainerizing applications is more and more common. We can even find a reason for this evolution in the growth undergone by the [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devops) movement.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIf you constantly have problems of environment configuration, if you must always wait at least 1 week to deploy a test in a client environment, if it is always complicated to onboard new people on a project... then you might consider using containers in your daily life.\\nThat said, I must say we have just scratched the surface of possibilities offered by Docker. I highly suggest you to keep documenting yourself on the topic.\\n\\nAnd if you\'re looking for online documentation generation or you wish to start writing a blog, check out Docusaurus! \ud83d\ude01\\n\\n<Newsletter url={websiteConfig.MAILCHIMP_URL} />"},{"id":"deployment-environments","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/deployment-environments","editUrl":"https://github.com/hunteroi/tinaeldevresse.eu/tree/master/blog/2021-01-01-deployment-environments.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2021-01-01-deployment-environments.mdx","title":"Deployment Environments","description":"At school, teachers usually focus on languages, algorithmic & clean code.

I hope you\'ll find it interesting! I am eager to read your opinion on the social medias.\\n\\n## What is a deployment environment?\\n\\nIf you are here, it is probably because you are wondering what is a deployment environment (not to confuse with a development environment which is a whole other topic).\\n**An environment in the world of software deployment is \xab a computer system in which a program or software component is deployed and executed \xbb.** It isn\'t me saying this, it\'s [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment). But this definition is pretty good, I must say.\\n\\nAs software systems, development processes and computer resources tend to be more distributed, they also become more complex and specialized.\\nWhen working on a project, you typically go through a _cycle_ of development, testing and release often evolving on different platforms with different resources and growing complexity.\\nThis is what we call \\"release management\\". This process allows rollout (which means \\"deploy something to environment\\"), testing and rollback if necessary (which means \\"remove the newly deployed version\\").\\n\\nFor the sake of understanding the rest of this post, I will briefly explain what are the different steps of product development an application usually goes through. Let me introduce you to the usual stages:\\n\\n1. Analyze the problem and come up with a digital solution.\\n2. [A lot of market stuff here involving solution validation, market research, etc.]\\n3. Design the software.\\n4. Implement it (development of features that solve the problem and/or add more value).\\n5. Test it.\\n6. **Deploy it** (today\'s article is focused on this particular point)\\n7. Maintain it / fix its bugs.\\n\\n## Why can deployment be difficult ?\\n\\nYou know that cycle I am talking about? Well it occurs from the 3rd stage to the 7th, more or less.\\nWhat is important to understand in this cycle is that we usually deploy different versions of the software on different machines, at different stages of the development process and following different requirements.\\nWhen you start developing an application, you already know your process management (I hope so, aha!). And in a lot of cases, you go with the [Agile methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/agile-methodology-process.jpg\',\\n        alt: \'Agile process\',\\n        type: \'image\'\\n    }}\\n>\\n    Made by <a href=\'https://www.shutterstock.com/g/Tartila\' target=\'_blank\'>Tartila</a>\\n</Figure>\\n\\nI would like to point out that the cycle hides another one when you\'re in the industry: you have to move the different versions of your application from environments to environments. But an environment is not only a machine where your application runs! It often also means different data, different limits, different goals, different processes, and much more things with the \\"different\\" adjective.\\nBasically, while your application is growing at a certain step (let\'s call it the youngest version), you have a few older versions before that need to move. If your company don\'t have sysadmins or that you work with the Cloud, the developer usually has to manage this rollouts and possible rollbacks (not to remind you that you don\'t just move the app).\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/small-fix.jpg\',\\n        alt: \'Dont Deploy On Friday\',\\n        type: \'image\'\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\nWhile I\'m pretty sure you now know how much complex it can get, let me point out that automation tools exist to ease our work (and thanks God!).\\n\\n## The different types of environment\\n\\nEvery organization has its own way of dealing with this topic, and usually it\'s even scoped on the project as all softwares don\'t rely on the same hardware & business requirements.\\n\\nLet me introduce you to some of the standard environments you might encounter.\\n\\n| Name            | Used by                     | Data                    |\\n| --------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |\\n| Local           | You                         | No client data          |\\n| **Dev**elopment | Developers                  | No client data          |\\n| **Test**ing     | QA engineers                | No client data          |\\n| **Staging**     | QA engineers and/or clients | Limited production data |\\n| **Prod**uction  | End customers               | Full production data    |\\n\\n### The local environment\\n\\nThis is _your computer_. The first place where all the work happens to be done. It\'s broken 80% of the time.\\n\\n#### Goals\\n\\n-   Work on your own tasks\\n-   See the result and make your merry way\\n-   Run the first battery of tests before sending your code to your colleagues\\n\\n### The development environment\\n\\nThis is the place where all developers\' work lies. It is acceptable to be broken (although you should avoid it if you don\'t like to have your colleagues complaining about \\"dev being down\\").\\nNobody but the team engaged in building the product should ever access this environment.\\n\\n#### Goals\\n\\n-   Run and test with development data\\n-   Verify that your code works well with everyone else\'s\\n\\n### The testing environment\\n\\nAlso called QA (for Quality Assurance), this is where the rest of your company enters the game. This environment is basically the last step before releasing the newly developed features to real end users.\\n\\n#### Goals\\n\\n-   Check for any issue that previous manual and automated tests did not catch\\n-   Prove that specific criteria are met (usually, validating the technical side of the feature)\\n\\n### The staging environment\\n\\nThis environment has a lot of names. People call it \\"pre-production\\" or even User Acceptance Testing (UAT).\\nIt is usually meant to simulate Production in as many ways as possible. It can be used to demo new features, ask for feedback from selected users validating the end to end business flow and train clients on upcoming changes.\\n\\n#### Goals\\n\\n-   Prevent releasing bugs to production\\n-   Validate end to end business flow\\n-   Train high-touch clients on new changes\\n\\n### The production environment\\n\\nThis is the sacred environment which you should never break. Real customers are using it. If you break it, you lose money. Got it?\\n\\n#### Goals\\n\\n-   Be the last depositary of all other environments.\\n-   Give the customers the solution to their problem(s) on a specific topic\\n-   Be reliable, bug free, always up and running\\n\\n## How to choose your environments pipeline?\\n\\nYou don\'t randomly choose between carved-in-stone pipelines that will answer all your needs. Pipelines are specially built for _the project to be deployed_.\\nI have seen a few things here and there, and there are a lot of hosting companies like Heroku which offer help to set up your deployment pipeline.\\n\\nThe following figure shows a few pipelines I heard of, have been working with or am actually using. Let\'s say each pipeline is the default one for companies A, B & C.\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/deployment-environments.svg\',\\n        alt: \'Deployment Environments\',\\n        type: \'img\'\\n    }}\\n>\\n    Schema of companies A, B & C \'s deployment pipelines\\n</Figure>\\n\\n### Company A\\n\\nThis corporation uses a well-known design called the DTAP approach standing for Development - Testing - Acceptance - Production.\\nThis is the most standard pipeline you can have. It is usually used (not as is, but largely edited) in big companies.\\n\\nHowever, the schema for this company has a few particularities I want to talk about : the number of running instances in each environment.\\nThe schema shows that you can choose between having a single instance of your application or several ones running at a stage of the process.\\n\\nObviously, choosing to host several instances at the same time costs more and has its cons but brings a few advantages :\\n\\n-   You can deploy specific features on a specific instance.\\n-   It allows your development team to work in smaller groups (e.g.: team 1 works on list 1 of features in instance 1; team 2 on list 2 in instance 2; ...).\\n-   It\'s cool to see when your instance runs smoothly and the others are down because they fucked up (don\'t get blind though, you\'ll get by that damn road as well).\\n\\n### Company B & Company C\\n\\nThese companies got rid of the \\"test\\" environment. This happens when you can afford to test your flow along with everything else in either your development environment or your staging environment. It is also a possibility for small teams.\\n\\nThe only difference between these two are the number of instances running at each stage. When building a small project, you usually go for company C\'s plan as there are less steps to do in order to deploy and go from one environment to another.\\n\\nIn my humble opinion, I like the schema C but I\'d rather simplify it again. For example, when I work on a Discord bot ([if you don\'t know Discord, check it out](https://discord.com)), I use :\\n\\n-   my local environment running locally and connecting to Cloud resources (such as a database and Discord\'s web service),\\n-   the dev/staging environment (_yep, it\'s a single env_) running the beta version of the bot, and\\n-   the production environment which hosts the final version of the bot available for Discord users.\\n\\nI cannot give you some sacred deployment approach dipped in magic sauce that will perfectly work for all your projects because it does not exist.\\nYou must come up with your own custom plan. But these defaults should at least guide you for a bit!\\n\\n**And you guys, what does your favorite deployment pipeline look like?**\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nDeployment environments are a big story and this article only has the purpose to gently half-open a door.\\nAs the DevOps trend is more and more intriguing in the eyes of companies, it is a plus to have experience with such things.\\n\\nI hope you will fully open the doors I wish to show you. Until then, see you next time!\\n\\n<Newsletter url={websiteConfig.MAILCHIMP_URL} />"},{"id":"what-makes-a-good-developer","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/what-makes-a-good-developer","editUrl":"https://github.com/hunteroi/tinaeldevresse.eu/tree/master/blog/2020-06-01-what-makes-a-good-developer.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2020-06-01-what-makes-a-good-developer.mdx","title":"What Makes a Good Developer?","description":"Hey there!

Welcome to my new blog website. For my first start here, I\'d like to introduce you to the key points which I think are the most important for a developer in their daily job!\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n<SEO\\n    uri=\'blog/what-makes-a-good-developer\'\\n    image=\'img/what-makes-a-good-developer.jpg\'\\n    type=\'article\'\\n/>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Reminder />\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. Think before write\\n\\nI sometimes see young developers jump right into programming their application without even according themself a moment to think about it. Of course, it will work for little easy programs with a few features. But as soon as it comes to building an entire application with different complex layers, it is mandatory to spend your time to take notes, analyze, draw schemas and make researches before writing anything.\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/looking.gif\',\\n        alt: \'Looking Logan Lerman GIF\',\\n        type: \'image\'\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\nA lot of applications are somehow unmaintenable due to poor or lack of analysis. And trust me, I have seen many projects falling apart because of that. **Beware, fellow developers!** You always want the best for your work.\\n\\n## 2. Communicate\\n\\n### 2.1. Get to know your client\\n\\nEverything you build for your client should be the result of a need. To identify the best way to create the product _they_ want, you should get to know your client. Learn what they do, how they do it and ask them questions on how they feel about it. If you want to make your client happy, you first need to know what can make them happy! :wink:\\n\\n### 2.2. Talk with your team\\n\\nIt\'s true that you gonna spend most of your time in front of your computer. But don\'t underestimate the social side of your job! As a developer, collaborating with your team is really important.\\nWho do you ask if you face problems? How should you proceed when you discover a bug in production? What do you do when you want to take a break from work? Each company has its way to deal with specific situations.\\nTalking with your colleagues opens you to know more about your company and the context within which you are developing.\\n\\nIt also makes it easier to work on a project\'s development with everyone. When you talk with your colleagues, you guarantee that you\'re not working on something which is already done or being developed by someone else at the moment.\\nIt is also a good thing to talk with the other developers if you have any blocking points as they might have experienced it before you. Being able to tackle problems quickly and release in the time allocated is a critical point for your developer career. It\'s your responsability to be productive and accurately estimate the time needed to complete tasks and complete them in the expected time.\\n\\n## 3. Follow established practices\\n\\nThis point is kind of related to the previous. As soon as you identify standards and best practices used within the company, you can work efficiently in compliance with what is expected from you. Talk with your team, ask questions, check all the things you can and agree on common conventions. This is not only important for the future of the current project you are assigned to, but also for your own career and reputation.\\n\\nAlthough, don\'t fear to look for ways to improve the process if you think it can increase the productivity and the efficiency of everyone.\\n\\n## 4. Be lazy\\n\\nThe first principle you should always follow when doing your dev job is to be lazy. But watch out, I\'m not saying that you should chill out any time of the day.\\nNah! I mean that you should **focus on delivering the minimum viable asked product**. Don\'t implement something that hasn\'t been asked by the client because \\"it will be useful one day\\". That\'s bullshit. You are most likely to have an unused code which nobody wants to remove because they don\'t know its purpose and if its removal is going to break anything. Ew.\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/dont-reinvent-the-wheel.png\',\\n        alt: \'theres no need to reinvent the wheel - meme\',\\n        type: \'image\'\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\n`Don\'t Reinvent The Wheel` is a beautiful example of being lazy. Don\'t spend your time doing something someone has already been doing far better than you. Just use their work! If you need to change a few things, you can still come back and edit it later.\\n\\n## 5. Write code\\n\\n### 5.1. Write clean & working code\\n\\nThis could sound silly but you are paid to **make things work**. But don\'t just throw instructions in a file and hope that they work properly. The sooner you make things good, the better the application will be.\\nNavdeep Singh wrote a story about [why writing good code matters, and how to do it](https://medium.com/better-programming/good-code-vs-bad-code-35624b4e91bc \'Good Code vs Bad Code\'). Check it out, it\'s neat!\\n\\n### 5.2. Write easily maintenable & enhanceable code\\n\\nIt\'s cool to have a code that works and does what it\'s expected to do.\\nHowever even if your code is understood by the computer, is it by humans? At some point, there will be another developer who will have to read your code and edit it. And it should be crystal clear for them.\\n\\nAlways think about how obvious your code is when writing it. Company\'s standards and best practices won\'t help you write understandable code. It\'s more or less the same situation when you\'re explaining your job to someone who\'s not IT: you **make things simple**.\\nKeep in mind that you are actually writing a part of an app that will someday be refactored by someone else. And you obviously don\'t want people to curse you when they stumble on your code.\\n\\n### 5.3. Test your code\\n\\nWhy should you test your code? You\'re sure it works fine but still! You really don\'t know your end users...\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/people-using-your-stuff-meme.jpg\',\\n        alt: \'When you get to see people using your program - meme\',\\n        type: \'image\',\\n        style: { margin: \'0 auto\' }\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\nI highly recommend project\'s managers to use the [**T**est-**D**riven **D**evelopment](https://medium.com/hackernoon/introduction-to-test-driven-development-tdd-61a13bc92d92) methodology for their projects.\\nTesting in software development is in my humble opinion the most important step in the process of product development. And there are many reasons to support this fact. Here are a few examples:\\n\\n-   **it ensures the product quality**: it prevents introducing avoidable bugs in the production environment;\\n-   **it saves money and time**: you can build things and be sure changes (e.g. optimization) won\'t break working stuff thus forcing you to check why feature X is not doing things as expected while you only edited feature Y;\\n-   **it helps secure the app**: it makes sure there are as little breaches as possible (everybody knows \\"zero risk\\" is a myth).\\n\\n## 6. See things from the user\'s standpoint\\n\\nEmpathy is really a bonus for developers. To put yourself in the place of the customer allows you to build easy-to-understand and easy-to-use applications.\\n\\nTalk with UX designers if you think your app feels too complicated to use when its purpose is as simple as drinking coffee from a cup...\\n\\n<Figure\\n    data={{\\n        src: \'/img/ui-vs-ux.png\',\\n        alt: \'UI vs UX - meme\',\\n        type: \'image\'\\n    }}\\n>\\n    From <a target=\'_blank\' href=\'https://www.reddit.com/r/UI_Design/comments/bblxum/ui_vs_ux/\' rel=\'noreferrer noopener nofollow\'>r/UI_Design</a>\\n</Figure>\\n\\nIt\'s also a good thing to have testers in your team who will act as end user and check if there is anything which doesn\'t feel right, produces bugs, is overcomplicated, etc.\\nThey obviously play an important role in the development of a project.\\n\\n## 7. Be curious and improve your knowledge and skills\\n\\nThis is the last bit of my post and I wanted to share the best advice someone gave me once... **Be curious about everything!** There are plenty of things and everyday brings a full new set of libraries, protocols, etc. There isn\'t enough lifetime to learn all on everything although it doesn\'t mean you shouldn\'t stay up to date.\\nHere are a few things I personally do to keep me updated on my favorite topics and improve my knowledge & skills:\\n\\n-   I try to always choose the challenging and hard work over the easy and already-done-several-times tasks.\\n\\n-   I go to events and meet people.\\n    The DevDay, the DevFM and other events organized by the [MIC Belgique](http://www.mic-belgique.be/ \\"MIC\'s website\\").\\n\\n-   I get involved in communities.\\n    For example, I\'m an active member of SpaceY!\\n\\n-   I try to help people (e.g. lend a hand in open-source projects).\\n\\nThe best thing you can do is to be proactive. Be passionate by your job like you are for everything that brings you joy!\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nDevelopers are not common resources. Good developer are even more rare. Stay involved and always question yourself. I am convinced this is how we learn!\\n\\n**What about you?
