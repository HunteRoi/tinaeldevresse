At school, teachers usually focus on languages, algorithmic & clean code. One of the things computer science students don't learn during their studies is deployment environments.
In my opinion, this is an important knowledge when starting to work for bigger companies as they tend to add more layers to their environments pipeline.

This article is more accurate and targets a certain field of people. I hope you'll find it interesting! I am eager to read your opinion on the social medias.

## What is a deployment environment?
If you are here, it is probably because you are wondering what is a deployment environment. Not to confuse with a development environment which is a whole other topic.

**An environment in the world of software deployment is « a computer _system_ in which a program or software component is deployed and executed ».** It isn't me saying this, it's Wikipedia. But this definition is pretty good, I must say.

As software systems, development processes and computer resources tend to be more distributed, they also become more complex and specialized. When working on a product (even more when the application is designed for the Cloud), you typically go through a cycle of development, testing and release often evolving on different platforms with different resources and growing complexity.
This is what we call "release management". This big picture is separated in different parts (such as CI/CD, Agile development and testing processes) which we will talk about in other articles. 

For the sake of understanding the rest of this post, I will briefly explain what are the different steps of product development an application usually goes through. Let me introduce you to the usual stages:
1. Analyze the problem and come up with a digital solution.
2. [A lot of market stuff here involving solution validation, market research, etc.]
3. Design the software.
4. Implement it (development of features that solve the problem and/or add more value).
5. Test it.
6. **Deploy it** (today's article is focused on this particular point)
7. Maintain it / fix its bugs.


## Why can deployment be difficult ?
You know these steps hereabove I've enumerated for you to understand how software development is done? Well, I must admit that the process is kind of messed up because we usually deploy different versions of the software, at different stages and following different requirements.

For example, when you arrive at step 4 (development), you might have a dedicated deployment environment. Same for step 5 (testing) and step 6 (production). We can even have in-between environments...
But an environment is not only a machine where your application runs! It often also means different data, different limits, different goals, different processes, and so on.

While I'm pretty sure you now know how much complex it can get, let me point out that automation tools exist to ease our work (and thanks God!).

## The different types of environment
Time to describe all the environments you might encounter in your daily life! Well, maybe not all. 
Every organization has its own way of dealing with this topic, and usually it's even scoped on the project as all softwares don't rely on the same hardware & business requirements.

Let me introduce you to some of _the standard environments you might encounter_.

It's broken 80% of the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                         	|

### I. The goals of a local environment
- Work on your own tasks
- See the result and make your merry way
- Run the first battery of tests before sending your code to your colleagues

### II. The goals of a development environment
- Run and test with development data
- Verify that your code works well with everyone else's

### III. The goals of a testing environment
- Check for any issue that previous manual and automated tests did not catch
- Prove that specific criteria are met (usually, validating the technical side of the feature)

### IV. The goals of a staging environment
- Prevent releasing bugs to production
- Validate end to end business flow
- Train high-touch clients on new changes

### V. The goals of a production environment
- Be the last depositary of all other environments.
- Give the customers the solution to their problem(s) on a specific topic
- Be reliable, bug free, always up and running


## How to choose your environments pipeline?
This question is tough because you don't randomly choose between carved-in-stone pipelines that will answer all your needs. Pipelines are specially built for the project to be deployed.

I have seen a few things here and there, and there are a lot of hosting companies like Heroku which offer help to set up your deployment pipeline.

<Figure data={{src:'/img/deployment-environments.svg', alt: 'Deployment Environments', type:'img'}}>
  Schema of companies A, B & C 's deployment pipelines
</Figure>

### Company A
This corporation uses a well-known design called the DTAP approach standing for Development - Testing - Acceptance - Production. This is the most standard pipeline you can have.

However, this one has a few specificities I want to talk about : the number of running instances in each environment. The schema shows that you can choose between having a single instance of your application or several ones running at a stage of the process.
Obviously, choosing to host several instances at the same time costs more and has its cons but brings a few advantages :
- You can deploy specific features on a specific instance.
- It allows your development team to work in smaller groups (e.g.: team 1 works on list 1 of features in instance 1; team 2 on list 2 in instance 2; ...).
- It's cool to see when your instance runs smoothly and the others are down because they fucked up (don't get blind though, you'll get by that damn road as well).

### Company B & Company C
These companies got rid of the "Test" environment. This happens when you can afford to test your flow along with everything else in either your development environment or your staging environment (**or** if you are working alone).

The only difference between these two are the number of instances running at each stage. When building a small project, you usually go for company C's plan as there are less steps to do in order to deploy and go from one environment to another.

I personnaly am OK with this idea but must admit that I have my own way. 
For example, when I work on a Discord bot ([if you don't know Discord, check it out](https://discord.com)), I use :
- my local environment running locally and connecting to Cloud resources (such as a database and Discord's web service), 
- the dev/staging environment (*yep, it's a single env*) running the beta version of the bot, and 
- the production environment which hosts the final version of the bot available for Discord users. 

I cannot give you some sacred deployment approach dipped in magic sauce that will perfectly work for all your projects because it does not exist. 
You must come up with your own custom plan.

And you guys, what does your favorite deployment pipeline look like?

## Conclusion
Deployment environments are a big story and this article only has the purpose to gently half-open a door.
As the DevOps trend is more and more intriguing in the eyes of companies, it is a plus to have experience with such things. 

**I hope you will fully open the doors I wish to show you. Until then, see you next time!**
