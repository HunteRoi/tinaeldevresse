Today's article is done in joint effort with my colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaumefaas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Guillaume Faas</a> in the form of a quick chat between two developers.
Please join me to thank him for his incredible involvement on this topic.

We both hope you will enjoy reading this article, as much as we enjoyed writing it!

## What are we talking about?
— Hey Guillaume! The topic for this article is the unit testing. I guess you've got spare time to discuss about it but if you allow me, I'll introduce it first!

Unit testing is part of a bigger strategy called "software testing". The idea behind these words is simply to test the features designed by analysts and developed by engineers.
There are a lot of testing types, and as you can see in the below tree, the types are divided between two big branches:
- functional testing – this means the goal is aimed on the code itself
- non-functional testing – this means the goal is aimed on the overall application or all the topics gravitating around like security, environment, documentation, etc.

With Guillaume, we talk about unit testing as this is a good first step when you walk into the software testing area. But don't be afraid to check for the others!
