If you know me, you should know that for quite some time now, I have been directing my professional career towards coaching and continuous learning (for me and for those in front of me!).

But then, why?

I have always been eclectic. I like to try new things out and see how I perform (and how I could do better).
This is one of the reasons I decided to study Information Technology (IT) in the first place.

In my professional area, learning and sharing knowledge and experience is a must.
IT represents an entire world moving faster than any other I know of.
Yesterday, you would hire someone to create your website from scratch.
Today, you can build it yourself with ChatGPT and other AIs which do most of the job for you.

The fact that everything moves so fast and that you can't master every single tech that exists in this world makes it clear:
- Stop trying to know everything, rely on others and learn from them!
- Nobody knows everything, let people learn from you!
- Teamwork makes the difference, believe in others.

## Short career but lots of life experiences

To be honest, I have been in several companies in my career. I wanted to see how green is the grass here and there.
And I have always seen the same thing: unique profiles either trying to pull up teams and projects
or dooming everyone and everything, slowing down progress and burning money uselessly. Unfortunately for me, it is more like the second.
Don't get me wrong though! I love creating. I love teamworking to bring people's solutions to life. And I especially love learning.
But after around 3 years of professional work in various organizations, I grew tired of _those who do not aim for excellence like I do_.
I mean, why would you develop a digital solution if it is to do it like crap? All you do is shoot either your future self or one of your fellow colleagues who will have to maintain it.
Which is exactly why I decided to turn tables.

I have taken things in hand to prevent other people to feel like they are trying hard for nothing.
I wanted to avoid needless burnouts like many before me how grew tired of efforts thrown in waste.

## Everything comes to those who wait

Surprisingly to me, in 2021, I got a message from a former teacher.
She asked me if I was okay to take some hours at university and sub for a sick colleague.

I have been teaching students at the Henallux since then, sharing what I know and most importantly my mindset and how technical excellence can bring happiness in a proper environment.

Most recently, I also had the incredible chance to bring my expertise in a wonderful walloon startup called [Pluriell](https://pluriell.app/).
This new adventure – my first coaching mission ever – was extremely positive for this client. And me too!
It gave them fresh insight, new methodologies, standards and objectives but mostly confidence and knowledge on what they do right and what they do wrong.
For me, it brought experience and connections, but also strengthened my will to interact with others, to teach and learn from them.
And honestly, backed by experienced professionals like [Yoan Thirion](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoanthirion/) and [Guillaume Faas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaumefaas/) who kept showing me the way, it felt like a wonderful trip.

In a more recent update of my life, I happened to become a co-organizer of the [Software Craftsmanship Luxembourg meetup](https://www.meetup.com/software-craft-luxembourg/) with Guillaume and [Arthur Grailet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-grailet-a647a1189/).
I am still learning the ropes, but being part of a new community and forced to go out of my comfort zone is really something I missed.

## Teaching & coaching

I think that both the coach and the teacher positions bring me what I feel _is the real definition of being an IT consultant_ : help people concretely.
That obviously includes understand how they feel (often simply listen to them), help them optimizing the way they work by pointing out where they can improve,
but also by showing them what they are already doing right.
And most importantly discuss things, give pieces of advice based on the context and bring them new value.

Teaching and coaching... these actions are actually quite close.
The idea is to build a story, narrate it and believe that people grasp the morality out of it.
Although if they don't, it is your job to juggle from different positions in order to bring them what they require to go forward.

I truly like the jobs. You need to understand how people think, and how you can convey the right information (and emotion) to them.
You have to master your subject, and if not: be transparent and admit you don't know.
They don't know either anyway, so you can (and should) just look it up with them so that everyone levels up!

## Back to the basics

Have you ever had this feeling that you did not understand the whole concept explained to you during class/training/whatever? Rest assured then, you're not alone.
And feel free to read your notes again after you changed your mind.
I graduated in 2019, and reading the lessons again now, it's game-changer! I now can really see that I improved and learnt a bunch of stuff in a short time.
This is really exciting for the future!

However, it feels quite strange for the 24-year-old me to teach people of my age or sometimes older than I am.
And I have to admit that forcing myself to _go back to the basics_, to understand what I have to teach in order to vulgarize it
and **share my passion**, it genuinely is a growing experience.

When I first took the job at the university, I was not sure about it. I mean, everyone has its share of impostor syndrome to deal with, right?
But then, each time I took a new role there, I proved myself wrong. I get into the classroom, do my stuff and everyone goes home happy.

## Conclusion

Sometimes you have to go back to your roots to grow even bigger than before.
I am excited for the surprises life will put next on my way, and I am sure everybody and especially I will learn more throughout the journey!
